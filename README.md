# mainframe-font
 
Mainframe is a monospaced pixel font.
It prioritizes clarity and readability, and it pays homage to two classic typefaces:
- Fixedsys, the oldest typeface in Microsoft Windows.
- The default character set used in Commodore 64.

It was designed to be used in the on-screen display of first-person view drones running the Betaflight open-source flight controller firmware.

## Features

- Easily distinguishable characters (for example: 0 vs O, 8 vs B)
- A battery icon with easily discernible levels (like Digital)
- Less icons, more explicit text labels for understandability (for example: GPS satellites, flight distance, black box)
- A very light crosshair design that is noticeable, but does not block too much view
- Consistent spacing and outline rules for a harmonious look

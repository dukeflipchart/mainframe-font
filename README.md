# mainframe-font
 
Mainframe is a monospaced pixel typeface.
It prioritizes clarity and readability, and it pays homage to two classic typefaces:
- Fixedsys, the oldest typeface in Microsoft Windows.
- The default character set used in Commodore 64.

It was designed to be used in the on-screen display of first-person view drones running the Betaflight open-source flight controller firmware.
